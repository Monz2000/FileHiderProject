# File Hider Application

Welcome to the **File Hider** project! This Java console application provides a simple way to hide and manage files securely. It uses core Java concepts and JDBC for database integration to enhance file privacy and organization.

## Features

- **File Hiding:** Move files to a designated hidden directory to keep them out of plain sight.
- **Database Integration:** Store and manage file metadata in a MySQL database.
- **Console Interface:** Interact with the application through the command line.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the File Hider application:

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Database
- JDBC Driver for MySQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-hider.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
```bash
cd file-hider

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

-Create a MySQL database.
-Update the database connection details in FileHider.java. Youâ€™ll need to replace placeholders with your actual database credentials


4. **Compile the Code:**

```bash
javac FileHider.java

5. **Run the Application:**

```bash
java FileHider

### Usage      
-**To hide a file:** Run the application and provide the file path when prompted. The file will be moved to the hidden_files directory, and its metadata will be stored in the database.
-**To unhide a file:** Run the application and specify the file name to restore it from the hidden directory.
-**Example**
-Here's a code snippet showing how to use the hideFile method:

```java
String filePathToHide = "path/to/yourfile.txt";
hideFile(filePathToHide, connection);

-Replace "path/to/yourfile.txt" with the actual path of the file you want to hide.

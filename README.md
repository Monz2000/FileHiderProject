#File Hider Application
Welcome to the File Hider project! This Java console application provides a simple way to hide and manage files securely. It uses core Java concepts and JDBC for database integration to enhance file privacy and organization.

Features
File Hiding: Move files to a designated hidden directory to keep them out of plain sight.
Database Integration: Store and manage file metadata in a MySQL database.
Console Interface: Interact with the application through the command line.
